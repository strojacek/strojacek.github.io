> "We have held to ideals created long ago, in different times and places, the very best ideals we could find. We have carried these banners unstained to this new place, we now plant them and hope to see them floating in the wind. But it is dark and quiet and lonely here, and not yet dawn." -Ted Nelson

What is Udanax Green?
---

Udanax Green is an open source implementation of the Xanadu hypertext system. It was developed in the 1980's as Xanadu 88.1. It was released to the public in 1999 under the name Udanax Green. The Xanadu hypertext system is a precursor to the Web and has the following features included:

- Permanent two-way links.
- Transclusion (reusing document fragments without copying).
- Full version control of content.
- Stable addressability (via tumblers).
